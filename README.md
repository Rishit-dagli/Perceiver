This Python package implements [Perceiver: General Perception with Iterative Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03206) by Andrew Jaegle in TensorFlow. This model builds on top 
of Transformers such that the data only enters through the cross attention mechanism (see figure) and allow it to scale to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. This, in 
part also solves the Transformers Quadratic compute and memory bottleneck.

Yannic Kilcher's [video](https://youtu.be/P_xeshTnPZg) was very helpful.
